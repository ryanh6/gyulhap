- A 3x3 board is displayed for all players to see. 
- Each cell of the board contains different a drawing of various attributes, notably Shape, Color and Background Color. For each attribute listed, there are exactly 3 possibles options
- Given 3 cells, for each attribute, if all cells are the same OR are all unique, then it forms a Set

Players may choose not to buzz in during their 10 seconds if they do not wish to. Failure to provide an answer after buzzing in will result in -1 point for the player.
